FREQUENCY: iteration or total

TODO:
 - fix frequency;
 - add concepts constrains on frequency
 - config file
 - open files operation
 - fix tilesize = 1
 - update bulk (indexes, smart pointer destruction/resize)

idee:
 - insert with custom probability
 - update the toAdd

tofix:
 - config enum
 - config lgn elements repetitions

CHECK: list performace: insert lgn in a list container so the there is no need to realocate all the elements that were after position to their new positions.
